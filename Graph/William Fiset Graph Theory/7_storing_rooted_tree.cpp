Best way to store a rooted binary tree is using arrays.
This technique also works for n-ary trees.

But in binary tree ::
	In an array, if the node is at index i then left child :: 2*i + 1 and right child at :: 2*i + 2;
	Also accessing the parent is very fast :: O(1) . For a node at index :: i the parent is at index :: floor((i-1)/2).

int main() {
	
	
	
	return 0;
}
