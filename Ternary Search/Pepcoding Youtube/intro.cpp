    -> Basic definition :: Take a problem. Find one-third part of Space of solution that will not give the answer. Eliminate that space.
                        
                        T(n) = T(2n/3) + O(1) = O(logn) with base = 3.
                        
    -> Time complexity comparision with binary search ::
            If we are given an increasing function or array.
            Then binary search will take ;: (1*log2(n) + 1) time because at each time we will compute only 1 mid and call f(mid)
            THe ternary search will take :: (2*log3(n) + 1) time because at each time we will compute f(c) and f(d) to check the answer.
            
            Hence time complexity of Binary Search < Ternary search. ********************************

                        f(m1) < f(m2) : This means there is a greater value after m1 hence our answer do not lie in range :: [l,m1]
                                        Hence try to search in [m1,r] interval
                    
                    Case 2:
                        f(m1) > f(m2) : This means there is a greater value before m2 hence our answer do not lie in range :: [m2,r]
                                        Hence try to search in [l,m2] interval
                    
                    Case 3:
                        f(m1) == f(m2) : We observe that this is only possible when maximum is between [m1,m2]

            Hence we find the max value of the function in O(log3(n)) time.
