/**

Deterministic Primality Test
	A primality test which tests a number n is prime or not with 100% accuracy.

Non-Deterministic Primality Test
	A primality test which tests a number n is prime or not with a small error (like fermat's primality test)

Where needed ? 
	Questions like : Given Q(Q <=10^5) queries, in each query you are given N (N<=10^12) , print whether
					N is prime or not.
					
					Here total time will be greater than 10^9 hence TLE
					Or if N <= 2^63 - 1 and Q <= 500 then also TLE :: SPOJ Problem


Fermat Primality Test : 
	The simplest Non-Deterministic Primality test technique which is based on Fermat's Little Theorem.
	
Miller-Rabin Primality Test :
	An improvised version Fermat primality test, it is also based on Fermat Little Theorem.
	
Deterministic version of Miller-Rabin Primality Test :
	We will study how Miller-Rabin test can also be used to test primes with 100% accuracy for 32 and 64 bit integers.
