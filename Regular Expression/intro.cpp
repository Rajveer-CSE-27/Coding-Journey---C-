Regular expressions are a standardized way to express patterns to be matched against sequences of characters (string in some cases).
#include <regex>

Target Sequence (subject) :: This is a sequence of characters on which we perform things i.e a subject. Generally specified by 2 iterators. (start, end)
                   Some functions of regex class also accept string instead of sequence of characters.

Regular Expression (pattern) ::  The pattern which is searched for in the target sequence. Generally a string.

Matches array :: Some regec operations allow to retrieve information about matches. This info is stored in special arrays called Matches array.
                 Ex. cmatch or smatch.
