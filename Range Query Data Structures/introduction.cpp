-> What are range queries?
	Let you are given a sequence of values :: a1, a2, a3, a4, ......
	These values could be or array, tree, graph, etc sequence.
	You are given queries of type : [l,r]
	And for each query you need to apply a fun(al, al+1, al+2, ..., ar) and generate the result.
	These are called range queries.
	Worst time to do it is :: O(n*q) but we will improve this in this topic.
	
-> Types of queries :: 
		1. Offline queries.
				When you are given all input queries at once and told to generate output at end.
		2. Online queries.
				When you are given a query and you need to generate immediate result of current query before moving to next query.
				OR
				When the input of current query depends on output of previous query or queries.
				
				
		NOTE:: Mo's algorithm is very famous for handling offline queries.

-> Types of updates :: 
		1. Point update :: 
				If in a query you are told to update a particular value then it is point update.
		2. Range update ::
		 		If in a query you are told to update a particular range of values [l,r] then it is range update.
		 		
-> Some popular concepts of dealing with range queries ::
		
		Prefix arrays
		Segment
		Fenwick
		Mo's algo
		Square root decomposition.
		Sparse table
		Disjoint set data structures.
		etc.
