/**

We have a binary string S of length N, and we have to find the number of substrings(that is, a contiguous range i to j) in which the frequency of 1 is strictly greater than the frequency of 0.
Constraints : 1<=N<=1e6;


Approach :: 
1.replace each 0 with -1
2.calculate prefix sum of newly formed array after replacement
3.now we have to find the number of sub-arrays who's sum is > 0.
4.let's say we have to find the sub-arrays ending at index j.
5.then sub-array [i,j] has +ve sum iff, pref[j] â€” pref[i-1] > 0 =>pref[j] > pref[i-1]
6.it means we have to find number of elements pref[i] which are smaller than pref[j] such that i < j.
